SOLUTION 
1. Moss Concrete Wall Construction
•	Use bio-receptive concrete or moss cement as the external surface layer.
•	Build a multi-layered wall including:
o	Moss concrete (outer)
o	Water retention layer
o	Drainage mat
o	Waterproof plastic barrier
o	Insulation layer
o	Main wall structure (e.g., brick or RCC)
•	These layers support moss growth while protecting the building from moisture damage.

 2. Embedding IoT Sensors
•	Place sensors within or just behind the moss concrete layer.
•	Sensors include:
o	Moisture sensor – measures moss hydration
o	Humidity sensor – detects environmental moisture
o	Light sensor – tracks sunlight exposure
o	(Optional) CO₂ sensor – measures carbon absorption rate
•	Connect sensors to a microcontroller (ESP32 or Arduino).

 3. AI Model Development 
•	Collect data from sensors for several days/weeks.
•	Label the data:
o	Example:
Humidity: 70%, Light: 400 lux, Moisture: 700 → "Healthy"
Humidity: 40%, Light: 1000 lux, Moisture: 300 → "Needs Water"
•	Train a simple ML model (e.g., Decision Tree or SVM) in Python using scikit-learn.
•	The model predicts moss condition in real-time:
o	Output: “Healthy”, “Needs Water”, or “Needs Shade”

 4. AI-Driven Maintenance Automation
•	Use predictions from the AI model to trigger:
o	Automatic misting pumps when water is needed
o	LED alerts for maintenance teams
o	Ventilation/fan systems if overheating or humidity is high
•	Reduces human labor, prevents moss death, and saves water.

5. Integration & Deployment
•	Run AI model locally on a Raspberry Pi, ESP32 (with lightweight model), or via cloud (if connected).
•	Display moss health status on a dashboard or screen.
•	Integrate into green buildings or smart city walls, with low maintenance and real-time alert
 6. Real-Life Applications
•	Commercial buildings – install moss walls in lobbies, facades, or conference areas.
•	Smart cities – use on highway walls or public spaces to fight pollution.
•	Schools/Colleges – for green projects and education.
•	Homes – as aesthetic, eco-friendly vertical gardens with low upkeep.
